To create a `config.yaml` file with the specified configurations, we will need to write the YAML content that includes the model as `gpt-4o-mini` along with some default configurations. Below is the implementation for creating the `config.yaml` file.

### FILE: config.yaml
```yaml
# Configuration file for the Orion backend

model:
  name: gpt-4o-mini
  parameters:
    temperature: 0.7
    max_tokens: 150
    top_p: 0.9
    frequency_penalty: 0.0
    presence_penalty: 0.0

logging:
  level: INFO
  file: orion.log

database:
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  user: orion_user
  password: secure_password
  db_name: orion_db

server:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 8000
  cors_enabled: true

features:
  enable_feature_x: true
  enable_feature_y: false
```

### Explanation:
- The `model` section specifies the model name as `gpt-4o-mini` and includes some common parameters like `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `top_p`, `frequency_penalty`, and `presence_penalty`.
- The `logging` section defines the logging level and the log file name.
- The `database` section includes connection details for a PostgreSQL database.
- The `server` section specifies the host and port for the server, along with a CORS setting.
- The `features` section allows toggling of specific features.

### Instructions to Create the File:
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the `config.yaml` file:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/ishandutta/Documents/code/orion-backend/orion
   ```
3. Create the `config.yaml` file and open it in a text editor:
   ```bash
   touch config.yaml
   nano config.yaml
   ```
4. Copy and paste the YAML content provided above into the file.
5. Save and exit the editor.

This `config.yaml` file can now be used in your Orion backend application to configure the model and other settings.
